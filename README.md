# Tech Debt Tracker
Tool to track and visualize Technical Debt with the aim of answering the age-old question of "What's slowing you down?" on a project.

# Setup

    npm install
```
    
Once that succeeds, run the following command to compile all client-side and server-side TypeScript files:

```bash

```
    
To seed the database with test data, first make sure you have MongoDB 2.6 or higher installed locally and then run:
